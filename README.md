# Microsoft Codefundo++ 2019
This project was the winning entry for Microsoft Codefundo++ 2019 from Bits Pilani, Goa. The problem statement of the hackathon was to come up with a use-case of blockchain in the electoral system.

## Idea and Inspiration

The election system is prone to a lot of malpractices. This project tries to address one of the critical issues of the electoral systems.
The electronic voting machines are one of the most sought after punching bags post-elections. Thousands of articles related to tampering of EVM's surface in front of us post announcement of the final results. We tried to reduce the burden on EVM's by creating a solid tamper-proof supply model of EVM's. The government spends thousands of dollars for transportation and security of these EVM's so that they are not tampered with. Our supply design reduces these costs manifolds by the application of blockchain technology.

## Tools and Technology 

The project uses Microsoft Azure blockchain services and is coded in Solidity.
